# TwinCAT
A guide to get you from zero to something using TwinCAT 3.

I had a difficult time figuring out how to use TwinCAT motion the first time. I'll try to save you some trouble by writing a short(?) walkthrough. Please let me know if something is unclear or incorrect, I'm also relatively new to this software. 

The first step to use any of the motion control tools in a PLC program is to import the `Tc2_MC2 module`. Importing the `Tc2_MC2` module will give you access to many of the basic axis motion controls such as `MC_MoveAbsolute`, `MC_MoveRelative`, and `MC_MoveModulo`.

To import the `Tc2_MC2 module`, go into the `Solution Explorer` and scroll down to the `PLC` section. Expand the `PLC` section and look for the `References` tab. Right click the `References` tab and select `Add library...`, then type "MC2" into the search box. Find the `Tc2_MC2` module, select it and hit `OK`.

To control an axis from within a POU (Program Organizational Unit), you need to declare instances of the function blocks you'd like to use in the variable editor. The basic function blocks that you will need are `AXIS_REF`, `MC_Power`, `MC_Stop`, `MC_Reset`, and one of the various `MC_<MotionType>` blocks.

Let's start with the `MAIN (PRG)` POU created by default when you make a new TwinCAT PLC Project. Start by declaring an instance of a function block. To declare an instance of the a function block, you need to type `<InstanceName> : <FunctionBlock>` in the variable editor. For example to declare an instance of `AXIS_REF`, you could put `ExampleAxisName : AXIS_REF` in the variable editor. Create a unique name for each function block you plan to implement.

After declaring an instance of the function block, you are able to write a program to control your axis. The first thing you should include in your program is `ExampleAxisName.ReadStatus();`. `ReadStatus` is a function defined in the `AXIS_REF` function block. Google: "AXIS_REF Beckhoff" for more information. Calling `ReadStatus` will update the values of your I/O variables locally. Now that you have updated variables, you can proceed to develop your state machine!

Developing a state machine is simple. First, right click the DUT (Data Unit Type) tab under your Project, and select `Add > DUT`. Select the `Enumeration` for the type and give it a descriptive name. I'll call mine `ExampleStates`.

After creating the enumeration, you need to fill in your states. By default, the enumeration will contain: 
```
TYPE ExampleStates :
(
	enum_member := 0
);
END_TYPE
```
I'm going to have three states for this example: ExampleInit, ExampleOff, and ExampleOn. After adding those three states, my ExampleStates Enumeration looks like this:
```
TYPE ExampleStates :
( ExampleInit := 0, ExampleOff := 1, ExampleOn := 2 ); //condensed to save space
END_TYPE
```

Now that we've defined our states, lets get back to our POU. We need to include an instance of our `ExampleStates` Enumeration. So, lets add `CurrentState : ExampleStates := ExampleInit;` to the variable declaration section. `MAIN` should look something like this now:
```
PROGRAM MAIN
VAR
	ExampleAxis 	: AXIS_REF;
	CurrentState 	: ExampleStates := ExampleInit;
END_VAR
```
